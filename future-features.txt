## Concept:

gnome-like app in gtk4 and adwaita gui, for add and manage game shortcuts


## Features:

Adding to steam, selecting images with steamgriddb api
Easy way to set custom images
Easy manage and edit shortcuts 
Simple menu like in bottles app
Use full compability with wine, port-proton and simple linux bins
I think good idea to add gog installer parser, to install gog games with this app


## Some backend stuff:

Use gotk for go gobject
Use sql(or something like) to manage db
